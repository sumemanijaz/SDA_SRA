We discussed the expected behaviour of the system in the stakeholder call this morning. The product manager said the platform shall allow new users to sign up quickly and should provide clear guidance when a profile is incomplete. Several people emphasized that the onboarding flow must be smooth and intuitive — not a list of technical fields but a simple, user-friendly sequence that helps users get started. The team agreed that the first-run experience should feel fast, with pages loading quickly and feedback messages appearing without noticeable delay.

Performance concerns were raised several times: load times should be consistently low and response time must remain acceptable even when multiple integrations are active. Phrases like "fast", "quick response", "low latency" came up in different ways — one stakeholder called out "we want near-instant feedback" while another noted "we're getting delay issues on large datasets". The backend APIs should support sub-second responses for the most common queries and provide graceful degradation for heavier workloads.

Security and data safety are non-negotiable. Multiple attendees stressed that the product must be secure and protected from unauthorized access, and that audit trails should record critical actions. The system should enable role-based access control so that only authorized personnel can perform administrative tasks. There were notes about encryption at rest and in transit, and phrases like "data safety", "protected storage", and "prevent unauthorized access" were used interchangeably during the conversation.

From a functional perspective, the interface shall allow administrators to create, modify, and revoke user permissions without direct database access. The application shall provide an API endpoint to query user activity and support filtering by date and action type. It should support batch import of users via CSV and enable mapping fields during import so that different customer schemas can be accommodated.

Usability surfaced in many ways: the team used terms like "easy to use", "intuitive", and "user-friendly" to describe the desired experience. Some stakeholders described the same idea as "minimal friction" or "fewer clicks to complete tasks". The design should simplify recurring workflows and provide sensible defaults so that novice users can complete tasks without training, while advanced users have shortcuts to accelerate frequent tasks.

Scalability and reliability were highlighted in planning. The architecture should support horizontal scaling and provide high availability for peak traffic. One engineer said "we need to scale horizontally rather than throwing CPU at it" and another added that "auto-scaling must prevent outages during traffic spikes". The system must be resilient: failures in a single component must not cascade and should recover without manual intervention.

There was also discussion about observability: the product should provide clear metrics, logging, and tracing so we can monitor performance and diagnose issues. The operations team asked that the platform provide dashboards for latency, error rates, and throughput, and enable alerting on thresholds that indicate degraded performance. They asked for logs that are structured and searchable to support fast root cause analysis.

Integration requirements were addressed informally. The product should enable third-party integrations using REST APIs and webhooks. Integrations must be authenticated and support token-based access. In conversations they said "we need to plug into Okta and SSO flows" and "there should be an easy way to stream events to analytics systems". Flexibility was emphasized: connectors must be configurable to handle different customer environments.

Several participants expressed concerns about data retention and compliance. The system should provide configurable retention policies, allow data export, and ensure that deletion requests are honored across backups. The phrase "compliance-friendly" came up alongside specific requests for export formats and certification readiness.

Finally, people repeatedly used functional signals such as "shall", "allow", "enable", "provide", and "support" while also saying things more conversationally like "we expect it to" or "it should be able to". The raw conversation mixed direct, prescriptive statements with open-ended concerns and examples, which mirrors how users actually talk about system needs.
